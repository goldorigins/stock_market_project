# stock_market_project

This was one of my favorite python projects that spawned entirely from my intrest with the stock market at the time. Wary travler, if you've stumbled upon this code I do hope you're hungry. Because I'm pretty sure its straight spaghetti. It was written by me, for me. There are many instances where I'd learn something new and just think "man if i started over with that knowlage, this whole thing would be so smooth" and Id just start over from scratch. But I guess thats learning. The ultimate goal of the project was to scrape data from Finviz and manipulate it to provide alerts on favorable market conditions. I initally began with much intrest in using beautiful soup 4. Which I did learn lots about it. But then I learned that Yahoo has a python library for this purpose. At that time my focous shifted from data manip to more of a genuinely wanting a stock market predicting bot, which i have since realized is quite, quite difficult.
